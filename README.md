Code used in Semantic Document Distance Measures and
Unsupervised Document Revision Detection (accepted by IJCNLP 2017)

All the distance measures are under src/main/java/com/spark/cluster
Please adjust the spark setting file pom.xml accordingly. 

To replicate the revision detection results, use the normalization function instead of the default distance measures. Simulated data sets are under simulated_data_sets. Wikipedia revision dumps can be found on https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-meta.html.
